## Problem statement
Traditional teaching often struggles to address every student's unique learning style, leaving about 25% unable to fully grasp the topic. This limitation has driven the shift toward digital learning systems, which aim to eliminate bias and ensure broader understanding.

While digital learning platforms employ various methodologies like game-based, activity-based, and personalized learning, most focus on tailoring content to a learner's progress and performance. However, they often overlook leveraging a learner’s pre-existing knowledge from other domains.

LUWA, a web-based programming platform, bridges this gap by identifying a learner's pre-existing knowledge (in the same or different domains). Using a pre-trained AI model, it tailors the learning path and adapts teaching methods to suit the learner's skill level—basic, intermediate, or advanced ensuring an effective and personalized learning experience.

## Objectives

- Develop a web-based personalized programming learning platform for students, self-learners, professionals and educators.
- Know interests of the learner.
- Assessing skill level (basic, intermediate or advance).
- Tailor the learning path based on skill level
- Adapt the teaching method using a pre-trained AI model.
- Continuously analyze the learner's progress and update both the teaching methods and learning path accordingly.
- Ensure a seamless, error-free user experience throughout the application.

## Deliverables

- User Registration and Profile Management.
- Personalized Learning Path.
- AI-Driven Teaching Method Adaptation
- Progress Tracking and Analytics
